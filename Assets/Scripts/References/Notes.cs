/* Things to do?
 * -------------
 * 
 * - Make separate box collider component for units that have the unit selection handler component attached to them. This should help with difficulties selecting objects, but need to make sure the parent is selected and not the box collider? 
 *          
 * - Shift marquee select should properly remove units from selection when box is not drawn over them and they have not been previously selected.
 * 
 * - Make it so that units are only selected when the marquee box is disappeared and they were under the box at its last position.
